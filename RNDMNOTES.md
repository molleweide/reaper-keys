# random notes

everything is moving on according to my plan.
with github I have the power to save and manage multiple larg projects.
this is absolutely tremendous. i can now start to slowly start prodding.
Yesterday I got a bit down at the end but I know that is only because I

started focusing too much on writing when my goal is to only learn the
program interaction right now. I need to learn how to dissentangle these too
because this will most likely make me learn faster.

Having multiple computers and always working on having things work
all the time requires me to really learn how the program works and this
forces me to really learn how the program works.

this allows for relaxation. now I have to star learning more about how
I use reaper fx as well which will be very interesting because I can
really imagine that fx in reaper are of as good quality as the rest of the program.

this is quite insane actually when one thinks about it actually.

also using modifier keys for backspace is awesome. it feels really nice.
and now that I come to think about it. it is not very nice at all to use the
thumb keys.

now this is going to be very interesting. What will this be like to never touch
the space bar ever this feels a bit insane actually and i dont know if ill keep
this but it is interesting for sure and when one is not used to something it can
feel very weird actually which is not something bad really but it takes some time
getting used to for sure man.
