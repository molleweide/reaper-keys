how can i tell how to send to submix

i could add the match name to parent. but i could
also create track name prefixesy

oooh! create three trackNamePrefixMatch list

now things are starting to come together.

and the important thing now is to just bind things together
so that i can get going with this. 

then i can improve on it and work more and more along the way
but now the ground work is almost finished.

i have to find out why i have so little memory left on the computer.
i have to then start producing and this will become a more andm
more crystalized flow that is a slow strter but it has an exponential
leverage effect because since you can modularize everything.
therfore I well be able to reuse everything always and work
faster and faster. this is absolutely insane actually.

nyw i just have to fix my body compltely so that i can work
efficently but this is unrelated to th actual production work.
but it is a huge prerequisit.

because when i can set sidechain comp, auto rout, dublicate
segments, and navigate fx. mix, pan and set effects. now weare
really starting to get things glued together. this will then
later allow for hooking up to the web with a web interface 
so that one can manage songs and projects with crypto.

and hook people up with computers and stuff so that others can
participate. this is pretty cool. then we could work together
multiple people with multiple computers and anyone in my 
vicinity can participat on a project. i just send people
links when they are on the same network as i am.

and later ths will probably allow me to set up automatic dj setupMidiInputPreProcessorOnSelTrks
and do automatic live production. we'll see what comes out of this.

by connecting mult computers and dong crazy production in a bit 
sci fi way. this is possible and i am going to do it.

i am going to fucking do this and this is going to be tha shit.
