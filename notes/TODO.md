# MIDI

- midi actions!
    get fast

- create custom insert tracks
    prevent master send!

- change fuzzy to fuzzy

* theme
    test
    fuck up as much as possible

* create custom action for bypassing currently highlighted and active window fx.

* create definitions/defaults/fx.lua
    is there something basic that I can do with an fx mode.

* fx > config state > log touched parameter

    very interesting config variable for ui dev

* hide tracks?!
