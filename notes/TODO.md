# REAPER KEYS TODO

## TODO priority list.

- add default route for syntax

  if match drum names >>> route to sum_drums
  if match music names >>> route to sum_music

* create custom action for bypassing currently highlighted and active window fx.

* create definitions/defaults/fx.lua
  is there something basic that I can do with an fx mode.

- segments

- denite >>> ability to set configs on the fly just like `:set` in vim?

- virtual keyb > shouldn't be that hard!!

- midi

  A new track fx mode would be ideal i think. So that I can use regular
  up down commands to navigate the fx list.

* fx > config state > log touched parameter

- fx > replace fx at index w/fxNew `<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<`
  so that I can switch synths

  very interesting config variable for ui dev

* hide tracks?!

## QUESTIONS

`can I rename the reaper.app file. eg. duplicate and rename reaper dir when new version??`

## regions =================================================

- add ability to save notes to the region. ?

# UNUSED KEYS ==============================================

folder keys f/c/<TAB>
enter track o/O

## RK internals

how does state_machine get the actual key press sent to it?

## FAST PRODUCTION SETUP ===================================

- templates

  create a function that takes and saves all components of the project.

  master
  drums
  music
  fx

  ```lua
  -- auto store and create importable modules of the current project
  -- increment names in
  for each zone
  for each group
  ```

## RNDM ====================================================

this is going to be so fucking awesome. the insane thing about
reaper keys markers is that you can make marks for any type of char,
which gives you a lot of marks, you don't have to worry.
and so this makes it possible for you to jump between a monstrous amount
of sound sources and tracks.

now iam just trying krumma krumma bracea rotera bak höften i have to rotate my hips
backwards. and you are suppose to write about rotating your hips backwards. imagine
that your hipis a big wheel in the middle of a folding knife and make this one roll 
backwards so that the underside pulls forward and the upper side rotates backwards a
roll back roll back and roll back some more. roll and roll and roll and roll.

oh would it make sense to make an implementation for outputting double keys
which would mean that you are not doing the thing that is roll back krumma
bracea krumma bracea och se till att kroppen verkigen lär sig det här.

jag gör det här eftersom att det är superviktigt. i roll back and clean and try 
to make it as clean as possible but the bain krumma roll the wheel backwards harder and
harder. it is an infinite chain pulling constantly all the time and this is the hard part 
about standing at the computer but if you get into a good habbit of doing this a lot then this will
be the new normal and that is where i want to be. 

now things are going to be absolutely amazing. i am going to contact all of my old friends that i haven't
talked to in a while abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzåäö so david is easing like a mature person

i also workout constantly. because i know how the body works really well by now and that makes it a lot
of fun to move in general. the more i move the better i feel and the better i feel the better i perform at
everything. you can't even compare. it is just amazingnntt
