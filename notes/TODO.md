    new project reaper-syntax

- dev
  log everything that relates to paths

- fx > replace fx at index w/fxNew `<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<`
  so that I can switch synths

- syntax/fx never use track indices >>> gui!!

- create custom o/O commands >> never enter text fields

- route log list and fdbk
  gui

- gui

  > list items in time selection

- gui
  show status of
  items / track / route / mixer?

* theme
  test
  fuck up as much as possible

* create custom action for bypassing currently highlighted and active window fx.

* create definitions/defaults/fx.lua
  is there something basic that I can do with an fx mode.

- denite >>> ability to set configs on the fly just like `:set` in vim?

* fx > config state > log touched parameter

  very interesting config variable for ui dev

* hide tracks?!
