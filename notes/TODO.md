# REAPER KEYS TODO

# VKB
- create timeout noteoff?
    temporary until you can do note offs

# FZF

# GUI

- learn gui
    what to do

# FX

- fx mode
    how is midi mode sensed?

- switch sound source
    rename main synth to `SRC_1`
    open add fx window
    replace with selection

- midi actions!
    get fast

- create custom insert tracks
    prevent master send!
    use custom track name
    default prefix = ''

- syntax use <.> as separator instead of <::>

- change fuzzy to fuzzy

* theme
    test
    fuck up as much as possible

* create custom action for bypassing currently highlighted and active window fx.

* create definitions/defaults/fx.lua
    is there something basic that I can do with an fx mode.

* fx > config state > log touched parameter

    very interesting config variable for ui dev

* hide tracks?!
