# REAPER FEATURE REQUESTS

- it does not seem to be able to midi / record overdub
  the output of one track to another track. (midi router w/overdub)

  I want to achieve a midi_router. explain what this is.
  basically I want to pipe all midi input through a track that
  I call midi router and then from this track I want to record midi
  to several tracks (target tracks) and I want to be able to do
  overdub recording onto my target tracks but currently it seems
  I can only record the output to a new take - is this correct?
